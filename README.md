# meal_plan_project
The attached program contains a form which prompts the user for 5 meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 2 snacks while also collecting information on the user's name, email, and goal for the week.
Beneath the form, the webpage contains two buttons labeled "Submit" & "Reset". the "Reset" button clears all input cells in the form.
When the user clicks the submit button, the program will generate a new web page which displays the provided meal plan in a table. The new web page also has 2 buttons labeled "Print/Download" & "Clear". The "Print/Download" button opens a pop-up that allows for the user to print or download their weekly planner, while the "Clear" button clears the page of data.
If an email address is not provided when the user clicks the "Submit" button, then the new page will not be created and an alert requesting the user to provide an email address will be displayed.
